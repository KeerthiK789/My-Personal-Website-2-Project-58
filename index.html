        <p>My favorite hobby is reading. Whenever I am free I read books. My favorite series of books is Harry Potter. There are so many types or genres of books. They are fiction, non-fiction, fantasy, realistic-fiction, historical-fiction, mythology, fairy tales, folk-tales, biographies, auto-biographies, etc. My favorite genre is fantasy, whech involves magic, magical creatures, etc. Reading is helpful to us, both physically and mentally. It helps increase vocabulary and comprehension, reduces stress, helps in falling asleep quickly, lowers blood pressure, fights depression, and more. And overall, reading helps us become a stonger and better person.</p>

        <h4>Harry Potter</h4>
        <div class="line"></div>
        <p>My favorite books are all of the Harry Potter Books. I have read then in 4th class, and I still remember so many details, and still love the books. Out of all 7 books in the series, I don't have a specific favorite. My favorite character from the series is probably Hermione Granger, one of the main characters. Hermione is a real role model, as she showcases talent, attention, bravery, leadership, and many more qualities, even in situations where most people aren't able to think straight. She is a very smart student and works hard, thus having magical abilities most others her age don't have. Being a girl who is born to non-magical people, she doesn't get any extra abilities by birth either. So all the talent she has is out of pure hard work. She always follows rules, but knows when they must be bent. She saved so many people because of her hard work and intelligence.</p>
